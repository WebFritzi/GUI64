# GUI64 v1.81
GUI64 is a graphical user interface for the Commodore 64 that allows you to run programs and games, as well as to manage files by cutting, copying, pasting, deleting, and renaming them. It moreover enables you to format and rename disks, browse your folders on your SD2IEC device, and create new disk images and folders. For detailed information on GUI64, check out the C64-Wiki page https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/GUI64.

**Control:**<br>
Mouse in Port #1 (mouse wheel support with adapter Micromys)<br>
Joystick in Port #2 (right click with Commodore key + fire)

# Binaries
There are currently two options: you either download GUI64.D64 and load GUI64 from disk with LOAD"*",8,1 or you use GUI64.PRG. The latter works great with a Kung Fu Flash cartridge. In this case, GUI64 is at your disposal right after switching on your computer.

# Code
GUI64 was developed in 6502 assembly code (ACME syntax) with _C64 Studio_ which you can download here:<br>

To build GUI64, download the files in the "Code" folder and open C64 Studio. In C64 Studio, go to "File->Open->Solution or Project", choose GUI64.c64, and in the next file browser click on "Cancel". The main file is GUI64.asm.<br><br>

# Coming in Version 2.0 (Work in Progress)
* File browser: Implementation of file viewer (menu entry "View" in "File" menu) to look into files in text and hex mode
* File browser: Copy files between SD2IEC directories; maybe even copying files between disks in the same drive via disk swap will be possible as well

# Future Plans
* Cartridge version of GUI64 v2.0
* Retrieve time from Ultimate 64 and SD2IECs with RealTimeClock
* Application programming interface: program your app for GUI64
